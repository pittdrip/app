# PittDrip

## Inspiration

The inspiration for PittDrip stems from a common dilemma: standing in front of a packed closet yet feeling like you have nothing to wear. In our fast-paced lives, deciding what to wear can become a stressful task, especially when considering the weather and planned activities. We wanted to create a solution that not only simplifies this process but also adds a layer of excitement and creativity to outfit selection. By harnessing the power of AI, PittDrip aims to be your ultimate closet buddy, transforming how you interact with your wardrobe.

## What it does

PittDrip is an innovative AI-driven closet assistant designed to help users curate and manage their clothing collections effortlessly. The app allows you to upload images of your garments, which are then automatically categorized into types, colors, and styles. But it doesn't stop there! PittDrip intelligently generates personalized outfit suggestions based on real-time weather conditions, specific activities, and your unique closet inventory. Whether you're dressing for a casual outing, a formal event, or a workout, PittDrip ensures you look your best while staying comfortable and stylish.
